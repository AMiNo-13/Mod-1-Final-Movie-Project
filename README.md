# Module 1 Final Project

Amin Nazerzadeh & Kevin Evans

## Introduction

With many industries currently crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, embarking on a new endeavor can be a very risky decision. At the same time, though, it is also a time of great opportunity. While the production of live-action cinema is currently impossible, the world of animation has been gaining respect in recent times, and could be a lucrative business to venture into. To support this theory, we have collected, sorted, and analyzed information from the Movie Database in order to answer these questions:

<ol>
<li>What is the trend of animated movies over previous 10 years?
<li>Who are the current competitors in this space?
<li>What are the top-earning animated movies?
<li>What is the correlation between the costs of making animated movies and their earnings, and how does this compare to non-animated movies?
</ol>

## Libraries used

To assist us in our research, we utilized the following libraries:

<ul>
<li>Pandas - data cleaning and analysis
<li>Matplotlib - data visualization
<li>Seaborn - data visualization
<li>Requests - api calls and webscrapping
<li>BeauitfulSoup - webscrapping
<li>Re - regular expression searches
</ul>
